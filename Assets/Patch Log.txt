ld patch 12 - Pixel art imported as point instead of bilinear (for that extra jaggy pixel art look)
Locked character movement at start
Disabled transparent camera flag SpriteRenderer once fade is complete (performance only, won't effect gameplay)

Reimported player sprites in a reasonable file so it wouldn't get compressed, removed compression. 

todo:

[ ] Pixel Perfect Camera.
